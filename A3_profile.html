							<p><img src="images/Jesse.jpeg" alt="alt text" width=150 height="200" style="float: right"> My name is Jesse Doolan (student number: s3897845) I come from an Australian background. I grew up in Melbourne, Victoria and attended St. John Bosco’s primary school, St. Bernards secondary college and currently RMIT university. My hobbies are skating, playing guitar/making music and of course I.T (i.e. Coding, playing games, building computers). My IT interests are gaming, hardware and coding. I love taking apart and putting together computers for fun and I love the challenge that coding provides to me. I have been using computers since i was 4 years old and have been coding since I was 14. I love the world of IT and everything about it. <br> <b>Website: </b><a href="https://s3897845.github.io/InfoTechWebsite/">https://s3897845.github.io/InfoTechWebsite/ </a></p>

							<p><img src="images/Jordan.jpeg" alt="alt text" width=150 height="200" style="float: left"> Yo, the name is Jordan, I come from a viết-Chinese descent, but I mainly speak English and Vietnamese but the latter not as fluently. I was born in Australia, going to 3 different schools growing up, thanks to Altona Meadows Primary School, Carranballac College and Point Cook Senior Secondary College where I graduated in year 12. My hobbies have a big range with soccer and cycling being my most active ones, but on the other hand, I will laze around to watch anime, read manga, draw and build things. Speaking of building things, I have built around 5 computers for family and friends as the whole process and technology fascinates me. I love not only hardware but also software that enables users to interact and use computers, which I would like to do with many others. My interests in technology stem from an introduction to computers from a young age and has fascinated me my whole life.

							<p><img src="images/Minh.jpeg" alt="alt text" width=150 height="230" style="float: right"> <br><br>My name is Minh Pham (student number: s3898301) I come from a Vietnamese background. I grew up in Melbourne, Victoria and attended St. Paul’s primary school, Braybrook secondary college and currently RMIT university. I enjoy cooking as a hobby and often spend my time exercising and watching shows. I enjoy programming because it fascinates me to be able to command a computer, even at a small scale; I hope I’ll be able to program computers with a larger impact in the future and expand my knowledge. <br> <b>Website: </b><a href="https://s3898301.github.io/Assignment-1/">https://s3898301.github.io/Assignment-1/ </a></p>


							<p><img src="images/James.png" alt="alt text" width=150 height="200" style="float: left"> <br>My name is James Lay (student number: s3902436). I am of a Chinese background, born in Sunshine hospital, and lived in Melbourne, Victoria for all of my life. I enjoy watching anime, surfing the net and mostly hanging around my PC for nearly most of the day playing games. Furthermore, I discovered an interest in coding such as the games that my friends and I always play, and we learnt the basics of the programming language ‘python’ before choosing to study at RMIT University. By doing so, we had prior knowledge before starting our programming class.  <br> <b>Website: </b><a href="https://jameslay2002.github.io/My-Project/">https://jameslay2002.github.io/My-Project/ </a></p>

							<h2>Group Process:</h2>
							<p>Throughout the course of assignment 2 our group had many triumphs and shortcomings when it came to producing the body of work we submitted. We worked well in a team environment as we all were on the same page and never argued over the delegation of roles or the work that was being produced by each individual member. Everyone was consistent in their work ethic and were very flexible when it came to spending hours outside of class to meet up and work together for extended periods of time. However our team did have its shortcomings, we started very late on the project and lacked initiative to speak up and organise the chaos that was our early teamwork. We often had to spend many hours together in person to complete the assignment by the due date. Leaving many of us tired and exhausted mentally. Going forward our group will be a lot more eager and strict to ensure work gets done on time and in an organised fashion to eliminate the problem of being behind, which in turn also helps the team members to relax more and produce even greater work and work ethic than before. We will also continue to regularly meet up in person to enhance our understanding of not only each other but our project as a whole, allowing us to properly convey our ideas and thoughts to better refine the current foundation of our project.
							</p>

							<h2>Career Plans:</h2>
							<p>Since receiving feedback from assignments 1 and 2 no team members have changed their current career plans and ideal jobs at all. For clarification Jordan wants to be a network architect, Minh wants to be a Security architect, James wants to be a database administrator and Jesse still wishes to be an IT manager. Common elements found between each ideal career path/job include, understanding of IT systems, ability to manage and maintain various IT systems, develop reports, strong time management skills and an ability to run successful IT projects. These skills are valuable for each job as they are the core fundamentals of an IT job/career, each and every team member of deltora quest are currently learning and developing these skills to obtain a career path that we can enjoy and flourish in. Aside from these small similarities found in each department of IT our career paths vary in many different ways. Jesse is interested in IT management where he would be overseeing projects and managing groups of people while the rest of the team would be directly involved in a part of the project rather than overseeing the whole thing. Jordan and Minh have the closest type of job as they are both architects, however they are in different fields one being networking and the other being security. Overall each team member has a very different idea of where they want to be in the future leading to a varied group dynamic where no two people have the same aspirations or even similar ambitions.
